# OpenCV-Canny-Edge-Detection
A simple Canny-Edge Detection implementation in C# using Open Computer Vision libraries. It takes video from a webcam, performs a standard canny-edge detection and then applies a bitwise AND on the white lines produced to turn them transparent, allowing a rainbow background to shine through.
